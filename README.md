# FilterU

This is a web application of face recognition system which makes retrieving specific photos faster and easier in which you are present and download them separately. This application will save your time which you require in scrolling through your gallery just to filter out the photos which you donâ€™t require anymore.

Requirements to run the application:
1.	Install python version>=3.6
2.	Install OpenCV
3.	Install Django
4.	Install cmake
5.	Install dlib

To generate the link to the web-application we need to open the terminal in VS Code and run the command - "python manage.py runserver" and we will be getting the link to the home page of the website.
